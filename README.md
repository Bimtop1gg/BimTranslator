## ⚠️ Troubleshooting the Duplicate Button Issue

Occasionally, after updates or bot addition, Discord may cache old commands. This can result in two **"Translate to my language"** buttons appearing.

### How to Fix It

This is caused by **Discord command caching**. You do not need to change any code:

* **Easy Fix:** Wait **10–15 minutes**. In most cases, the cache will automatically refresh, leaving only one button.
* **Fast Fix (If the wait fails):**
   1.  Kick the BimTranslatorBot from your server.
   2.  Re-invite it immediately.
    
    This aggressive step guarantees a clean command cache reset at the server level.
